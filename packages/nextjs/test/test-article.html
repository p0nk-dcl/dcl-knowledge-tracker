            <p>In this article, the authors—all seasoned harm reduction workers—offer their perspective on the changes
                in the Dutch harm reduction field. The claims in this article are based on historic as well as novel
                academic and grey literature that support the more subjective experiences of the authors. This article
                is a commentary and not intended as an academic paper.

                The origins of harm reduction in the Netherlands (1970–1990)
                Starting in the 1970s and continuing throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Netherlands emerged as a
                pioneer in developing and implementing harm reduction services, even though these interventions were not
                labelled as such at that time. The pragmatic and practical approach towards drug use for which the Dutch
                became famous was not the result of a grand strategy. Rather, harm reduction interventions and concepts
                grew organically and from the bottom up, responding to the emerging harms associated with injecting drug
                use [1]. Political support followed gradually due to a shared sense of urgency [2].

                The central role of the drug user movement
                In the early 1980s, larger cities in the Netherlands were faced with a number of challenges, including
                fatal overdoses, high prevalence rates of HIV, viral hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) among people who
                injected drugs, open drug scenes, injecting drug use in public spaces, low-level street crime, and the
                visible destitution of certain areas within these cities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neither traditional responses, such as abstinence-oriented drug treatment, nor incarceration or other
                forms of repression delivered the desired results. In response, people who use drugs began to organise
                themselves [3]. The Medisch-sociale Dienst Heroïne Gebruikers (MDHG) [4] in Amsterdam and the Junkiebond
                [5] in Rotterdam were formed, alongside similar groups in various Dutch cities, all becoming central
                figures in the drug policy debate. These ‘Drug Users Unions’ challenged repressive and counterproductive
                policies, demanding access to life-saving services and a health-centred approach to drug policy. They
                mobilised people, organised demonstrations, published critical literature on methadone programmes,
                initiated needle and syringe programmes, and pressured local authorities to support the implementation
                of harm reduction services [6].

                In 1974, the MDHG opened the first informal safe space for drug use in Amsterdam, supported by the local
                government [7]. Here, people could consume their drugs in a safe environment and buy drugs from an
                in-house dealer. Additional services included medical care, social and housing support, legal
                assistance, and other essential services, including meals and showers. The organisation provided an
                alternative to the ‘official’ facilities, where people who use drugs felt safe, understood and
                respected, instead of being controlled or patronised.
            </p>
            Services provided by the Drug Users Unions were grounded in the principle of peer support. They played a
            crucial role in scaling up opioid agonist treatment [8], alerted each other about adulterated batches of
            drugs, provided information and guidance on responding to overdoses, as well as essential information
            and training on HIV prevention.
            <p>
                A policy shift from repression towards person-centred care and harm reduction
                Community-based organisations cooperated closely with Drug User Unions to provide low-threshold
                services, including outreach work, day and night shelters, and other essential support. On June 8, 1979,
                the Municipal Health Service in Amsterdam began to operate a methadone bus, one year after Rotterdam and
                The Hague had already done so. The project proved highly successful, with 352 individuals enrolled by
                October 1979, a number that surged to more than 1200 by 1981 [9]. In that same year, the ‘drug user
                movement’ launched the first underground needle and syringe programme, which continued until 1987. It
                was subsequently absorbed by local authorities who opted to implement needle and syringe programs on a
                large scale [10]. By the late 1980s, these programmes were operational in 60 Dutch cities.
            </p>
            These initiatives reflected a broader transformation in Dutch drug policy, which sought to balance care
            with ‘law and order’ through a pragmatic harm reduction approach. Instead of focusing solely on control
            and punishment, the Netherlands started to experiment and collaborate closely with the drug user
            movement. Local policymakers and law enforcement officials came on board and gradually adopted the
            concept of ‘harm reduction’Footnote1 as an important public health strategy and a pillar of Dutch drug
            policy. Importantly, local police and law enforcement agencies supported and tolerated various harm
            reduction measures, such as supervised consumption sites and drug checking, focusing their efforts on
            combating the drug trade rather than targeting individual users [11]. Drug consumption and the
            possession of quantities of drugs for personal use were de facto decriminalised in the Netherlands,
            meaning they remained a criminal offence in legislation, but not actively enforced in practice.Footnote2
            <p>
                Resisting external pressures
                The Netherlands publicly distanced itself from more repressive drug policies enacted by other countries,
                where people who use drugs were often forced to abstain from drugs and faced punitive measures for
                possession or use. Giel van Brussel, a medical doctor at the Municipal Health Service in Amsterdam,
                openly criticised the drug policies of Germany and Sweden, where drug services remained firmly rooted in
                the law enforcement paradigm. He stated that in these countries, the issue was approached in a
                totalitarian, almost fascistic way [12].

                Conversely, Dutch policies were met with international resistance from the outset, with several
                countries labelling the Netherlands as a ‘drugs paradise’ [13]. The Dutch were blamed for the increased
                availability of drugs in other European countries, prompting various EU nations to call for a more
                restrictive and prohibitionist drug policy, to ‘send the right message’ to drug criminals and young
                people experimenting with illegal substances [14]. Thanks to several courageous politicians, the Dutch
                response was protected and the Netherlands became an international advocate for the harm reduction
                approach.
            </p>
            The new ‘normal’—integration and institutionalisation (1990–2010)
            Since the 1990s, harm reduction had become an integrated part of the local health and social care system
            in the Netherlands. Services were available, accessible, and acceptable to most people who use drugs,
            and were generally of good quality. Harm reduction interventions delivered on their promises, positively
            impacting both the individual health and well-being of people who use drugs, as well as public order in
            cities. Full participation in harm reduction programmes, including needle and syringe programmes, opioid
            or heroin-assisted treatment,Footnote3 and the now officially sanctioned drug consumption rooms was
            found to significantly reduce the incidence of HIV and HCV infections among people who use drugs [15].
            Most people who used heroin were connected to social and health care services, and as a result,
            homelessness, public drug use, petty crime, and overdoses declined. The success of harm reduction
            services in the Netherlands has been highlighted by some commentators as one of the country’s greatest
            public health achievements [16].

            Dutch drug policy: an evaluation
            In 1995, an extensive evaluation of the Dutch drug policy was published, analysing the previous 20 years
            of policy implementation [17]. The report highlighted the successes of the health-based approach,
            including the low and declining use of heroin and cocaine/high-risk drug use among minors, decreased HIV
            infection rates among people who inject drugs, and stable, low mortality rates [18]. However, it also
            acknowledged some ongoing societal challenges, including drug-related public nuisance and social
            disruption, and the rising involvement of criminal organisations in drug trafficking. To address these
            issues, the evaluation recommended amendments to the Dutch approach, including an increased focus on
            reducing public nuisance and crime, and to adapt to the evolving drug landscape, such as the increased
            use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy [19].

            Institutionalisation and re-criminalisation
            By the early 2000’s, most street-based people who used drugs lived in sheltered or supported housing.
            They received social welfare, medical care and tailored drug treatment, and drugs could be consumed
            safely in on-site drug consumption rooms [20]. This led to significant improvements in many individual
            lives, as well as in public health and safety. However, a small minority did not fit into these existing
            structures, and tolerance towards those who continued to engage in public drug use and (petty) crime
            began to decline [21]. The 1995 evaluation of Dutch drug policy recommended a ‘tougher’ approach towards
            those causing public nuisance, leading to various criminal justice measures, including compulsory
            treatment and other forensic psychiatric interventions [22].

            Over time, funding aimed at reducing the perceived nuisance resulting from drug use was increased,
            involving care providers, the police, judicial authorities, and the probation service. Policy
            recommendations included expanding police and prison capacities to combat drug trafficking, eventually
            paving the way for a more security-based drug policy approach. In the international arena, the
            Netherlands shifted to a more conciliatory stance, emphasising drug control and crime prevention to
            bolster its image as a crime-fighting entity [21]. Consequently, during this period, the Netherlands
            stopped actively promoting itself as a leader in drug policy innovation and harm reduction.
            <p>
                Increased focus on security and crime prevention (2010–2024)
                Over the past two decades, the economic and political landscape in the Netherlands has shifted
                drastically, mirroring wider trends across Europe. Decades of neo-liberal policies have widened the
                societal gap between ‘the haves and the have-nots’, exacerbating issues like poverty, homelessness, and
                societal distrust. Right-wing and populist parties have gained increasing support, hardening societal
                attitudes toward marginalised populations, who, as in many nations, have been scapegoated to distract
                from the harms of neoliberal policies [23, 24].
            </p>
            In line with these developments, Dutch politicians have shifted their attention to the challenges
            associated with drug production and trafficking. The Netherlands, with its long tradition as a hub for
            drug smuggling and production [25], is a key producer of ecstasy, methamphetamines, and cannabis, and
            serves as a major transit point for cocaine and heroin. Furthermore, individuals in the Netherlands have
            become increasingly involved in criminal activities on the darknet [26]. In 2020, Dutch policy advisors
            argued that the country’s tolerant stance on drug use were exacerbating many of these issues [27].
            <p>
                As this decade progressed, the Dutch government intensified its focus on security and crime prevention,
                enhancing law enforcement capabilities and increasing the mandate of the police and judiciary. This
                shift has involved implementing stricter measures to combat drug-related crimes and allocating
                substantial resources to prevent the Netherlands from becoming a 'narco-state'—a term coined by
                conservative politicians in the public debate and popular media [28]. However, to date, these efforts
                have not led to a reduction in production, trafficking, or consumption of drugs. The Dutch drug market
                remains diverse and accessible, with prices for drugs like cocaine remaining stable over time [29].
                Concerningly, the focus on drug control has diverted attention and resources away from other criminal
                offences. An estimated 60–80% of all police capacity is currently allocated to handling drug-related
                crime, a situation that has overwhelmed the justice system with non-violent drug cases [30, 31].
            </p>
            <p>
                Harm reduction budget cuts
                In parallel with the heavy investments in the justice system, harm reduction services in the Netherlands
                have suffered from significant budget cuts. These cuts have gone largely unnoticed due to the
                decentralised nature of government budgets and the restructuring of funding streams. Due to the
                successes of harm reduction in the past years, drug use became less visible and was no longer considered
                a major societal problem. Consequently, harm reduction programmes became an easy target for austerity
                measures, leading to long waiting lists and severe staff shortages [32].
            </p>
            <p>In recent years, harm reduction organisations like Mainline have observed significant changes in the
                support and care system for people who use drugs. The institutionalisation of harm reduction has led to
                the imposition of strict ‘house rules’ and rigid perceptions of what constitutes ‘good conduct’ inside
                services. Furthermore, low-threshold services, including drug consumption rooms, are dealing with an
                increasing number of clients presenting complex and multi-layered issues, including drug and alcohol
                use, health problems, homelessness, (untreated) mental health conditions, and feelings of hopelessness.
                Minoritised groups, and in particular, migrant communities, often lack access to the Dutch harm
                reduction services altogether [33]. Moreover, insufficient funding puts excessive pressure on staff, who
                often lack the necessary resources to adequately meet the needs of these target groups [34]. In an
                increasingly inaccessible system, harm reduction professionals are struggling to adapt to shifting
                demographics among clients and rapidly emerging drug trends. Consequently, the Dutch harm reduction
                infrastructure appears far from future-proof.</p>
