# DCL Knowledge Tracking

## Overview

DCL Knowledge Tracking is a blockchain-based tool designed to address the challenge of tracking, recognizing, and valuing local expertise. 
This project aims to create a more equitable system for acknowledging contributions from diverse knowledge bearers, particularly those from the Global South.


## The Problem

Metis is a solution designed to address three critical challenges faced by most NGOs and their partners in the field:

1. The undervaluation and lack of proper recognition (for example: socially, financially and professionally) for diverse forms of knowledge contributions
2. The need for improved tracking and discoverability of valuable work and expertise
3. The requirement for secure and censorship-resistant documentation of work in challenging environments


## Our Solution

Metis is a (Dapp) blockchain-based publishing system that provides NGOs with a powerful tool to address the challenges outlined above. It's what we call an on-chain tool, because we rely on blockchain to store information.
Metis offers a comprehensive solution for:
- Recognizing and valuing diverse knowledge contributions (Anyone can like and send funds over internet to any contributor)
- Improving tracking and discoverability of valuable work and expertise (Putting the work onchain, enables author to build an onchain portfolio for all the contributors)
- Securely documenting and preserving information (resisting censorship and information suppression by leveraging IPFS and blockchain technologies)
